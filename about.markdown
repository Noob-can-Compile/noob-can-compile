My name is Krunal Kshirsagar, a privacy preserving machine learning researcher and differential geometry enthusiast.
I currently work as a Research Engineer and Writer at [Openmined](openmined.org).
My research interest lies at the intersection of differential geomoetry, probabilistic methods and privacy preserving machine learning in the medical imaging domain with a special interest in brain imaging analysis including shapes, structural and functional data while preserving the privacy of the data.
Besides my research interest, I have previously worked at [Appliedcloudcomputing](https://www.appliedcloudcomputing.com/) as a software development intern,
